# Visual-Basic-Final-Project
This project was a group project. The class was divided into several groups, and each group was assigned a project topic. From that topic, each group was to develop a project for presentation on finals week.
The topic required the program to have the following elements :
1. Using Files: saving and loading text files (.txt), and printing.
2. Multiple forms: a minimum of 3 was required, but more could be used.
3. Functions: a minimum of 5 was required, and at least 3 needed to have multiple parameters.
