Being that this was the first significant coding project ever done, the most important learning experience here was learning to work as a team. Also learning how to work on a project via multiple computers was a very interesting tidbit to figure out. This method was chosen over each person working on their own version to prevent unecessary duplicate work, or version mismatches and as a result, overwritten code that may be important.
